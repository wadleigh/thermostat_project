Thermostat Project Overview

Done:
- read in temperature 
- control motor

To do:
- log temperature
- set desired temperature 
- adjust motor accordingly
- build thing to attach motor to heater


Extras:
- log in weather data
- adjust setting based on weather, not just temperature 
- figure out a sleep mode so it's not running all the time (an presumably using maybe significant energy)
- make a schedule of what temperatures it should be at what time
- figure out how to control it remotely
- learn how to most efficiently adjust the temperature
- add a motor and thermometer in the bedroom attached to something, maybe the ESP8266 wifi thing, and control the temp in there also with the pi.  This: https://maker.pro/esp8266/tutorial/how-to-program-esp8266s-onboard-gpio-pins could be helpful
